## üìù Effective Prompts & Impact

### 1. Initial Project Setup
**Prompt**: "Build the first 3-4 sections of a responsive landing page based on a provided Figma design. This involves implementing a Navigation Bar, Hero Section, Features/Benefits Section, and Partners/Companies Section, adhering to pixel-perfect design, responsive behavior, and clean code structure using Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS."

**Impact**: Established project structure, component hierarchy, responsive patterns

### 2. Component Architecture
**Prompt**: "Create a modular component structure with TypeScript interfaces, proper prop types, and reusable components for the landing page sections."

**Generated**: TypeScript interfaces, reusable components, proper prop validation

### 3. Responsive Design Implementation
**Prompt**: "Implement pixel-perfect responsive design with mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints and proper image optimization."

**Generated**: Responsive image handling, mobile-first layouts, optimized components

### 4. Image Path Optimization
**Prompt**: "Update all image paths to use the correct format and ensure proper Next.js Image component usage."

**Generated**: Updated all image paths to include `/images/` prefix

## üéØ AI Prompt Engineering Strategies

### Effective Prompt Patterns
1. **Specific Requirements**: "Implement [feature] with [technology] following [pattern]"
2. **Context-Rich**: "Given existing codebase, create [component] that integrates with [components]"
3. **Iterative Refinement**: "Fix [issue] by [approach] while maintaining [constraints]"

### Best Practices
- Include existing code context
- Specify technical constraints
- Request validation approaches
- Build complexity gradually

## üîç Validation Process

### Code Validation Steps
1. **Syntax Check**: TypeScript compilation
2. **Runtime Test**: Browser functionality
3. **Responsive Test**: Mobile/desktop behavior
4. **Accessibility Check**: ARIA compliance
5. **Performance Check**: Bundle optimization

### Refinement Process
1. **AI Generation**: Generate initial code
2. **Manual Review**: Check edge cases
3. **Testing**: Validate across devices
4. **Optimization**: Refine performance
5. **Documentation**: Update comments

## üìà Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
